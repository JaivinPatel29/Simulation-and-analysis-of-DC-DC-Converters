# Simulation-and-analysis-of-DC-DC-Converters
Buck, boost and buck-boost converters have been simulated at 25%, 50% and 75% duty cycles in order to understand the DC-DC converter topology.
Input/output voltages, output current and pulse generator waveforms have been observed in oscilloscope.
The theoretical values calculated from formulas are compared with the Simulink model values.
